# Conclusion

Our exploration revealed several important insights into the EV landscape. One key takeaway is that rising fuel prices significantly drive EV adoption by highlighting the cost savings and sustainability of electric vehicles. Additionally, charger accessibility and diversity, particularly advanced types like Level 2 and DC Fast chargers, are critical for adoption, as seen in leading states like California. In Washington State, counties with more than 25 stations show a positive link between charger availability and EV numbers, but no clear connection was found between chargers and the proportion of BEVs. However, limitations in our study include regional biases, a lack of detailed policy data, and insufficient consideration of socio-economic factors and charger usage patterns, which constrain the analysis. Future directions could explore how state-level policies, renewable energy integration, and public-private partnerships affect EV infrastructure growth, alongside economic incentives and battery technology advancements. A key lesson learned is that while expanding infrastructure is vital, its effects on EV adoption can vary, emphasizing the need for localized strategies and a broader examination of policy and consumer behavior factors to fully understand adoption trends.
