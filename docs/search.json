    "text": "1 Introduction\nElectric Vehicles (EVs) are becoming more popular as people look for new and efficient ways to travel. EVs are cars that run partly or fully on electricity. Unlike traditional cars that use gas, EVs are powered by batteries and are more energy-efficient. The EV market in the U.S. is growing quickly, helped by falling battery prices, government support, and better charging infrastructure.\nWhile many focus on how EVs help the environment, this project looks at something different: the sales and number of EVs in the United States. By studying data on EV registrations/counts, fuel prices through time, and charging stations, this project will explore how EV market or counts are changing in different parts of the United States.\nWe chose this topic because population of EVs show how the car industry is changing and how people’s preferences are shifting. Studying the counts of EVs can reveal important trends, challenges, and opportunities that can help businesses, governments, and buyers understand where the market is headed and how they are influenced by various factors.\nThis project will answer questions like:\nWhat is general look of EV market, and what factors affect it ?\nHow have EV counts changed over time in different states and regions?\nHow the counts of different EV brands are distributed in a specific state?\nWhat is the difference in counts between Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs)?\nHow do factors like the number of charging stations and fuel prices affect EV sales?\n….."

    "text": "2.1 Description\n\nAlternative Fuel Price Report in the US Link: https://afdc.energy.gov/fuels/prices.html Last Update/Frequency: Oct 2024 Dimension: 10 columns, 103 rows Original Format: Excel Plan to Import in Form: CSV Description: This dataset provides the average fuel prices (in dollars per gasoline gallon equivalents, GGEs) in the United States for various fuel types, including Biodiesel (B99-B100), Ethanol (E85), Natural Gas (CNG), Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG), Propane, Gasoline, and Diesel. The data, consisting of numerical values, captures the fluctuations in fuel prices over time, spanning from April 10, 2000, to April 1, 2024. However, there are several issues with the dataset. Notably, there are numerous missing values, particularly for LNG and B99-B100, especially in the earlier years. Additionally, the frequency of data collection is inconsistent. For instance, in 2000, data was collected only once (on April 10), whereas in 2004, data was collected twice (on March 3 and November 15). This inconsistency could pose challenges when attempting to analyze or compare price trends across years.\nCharge Station Data in the US Link: https://driveelectric.gov/stations Last Update/Frequency: At least once a year Dimension: 75 columns, 73967 rows Original Format: CSV Plan to Import in Form: CSV This data is interested that it shows all the geomgraphly distribution along with all EV charging station in the state. In this data set it provide both numerical data and categorical data: For numerical data, it collects and present the charying types counts and location in term of latitude and attitude. For the categorical data, it represents the area, public status, restrict access or so. This dataset does not contain much missing value and majority indicate the distribution information along with area and charge types. Many values in many columns are missing and the dataset is sparse in some part, but as long as the values we need are available, then we will be able to analyze.\nElectric Vehicle Population Data in the State of Washington Link: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/electric-vehicle-population-data Last Update/Frequency: October 19, 2024 Dimension: 17 columns, 210165 rows Original Format: CSV Plan to Import in Form: CSV Description: This dataset shows the Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) that are registered through the Washington State Department of Licensing (DOL) in 2020. Specifically, this dataset provide variables in term of brand of EV and county location of sales along with their EV types, Model Make, and Ectric Range. There are no missing values in term and the dataset contains both numerical and categorial correspond to parameters in Electric Vehicle and location information. However, there are many 0 values in the column Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP), which are not real values, so we can’t use this dataset to discuss the price of EVs.\nElectric Vehicle Population Size History By County in the State of Washington Link: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/electric-vehicle-population-size-history-by-count Last Update/Frequency: October 19, 2024 Dimension: 10 columns, 23440 rows Original Format: Excel Plan to Import in Form: CSV Description: This shows the number of vehicles that were registered by the Washington State Department of Licensing (DOL) each month from 2020 to 2024. The data is separated by county for passenger vehicles and trucks. Specifically, it provide detail numerical information about Batteries, Plug in, hybrid, total number of EV, and non EV total number. It could be suggested that we could use pie chart or other graph to display the distribution of EV vs Non-EV sales along with Area. There are no missing data, but the data is not organized well. For example, the rows are not sorted based on the dates, so we need to be careful when dealing with it."

These likely represent fields that are either rarely applicable or not consistently reported across all charging stations, like RD.Blended.with.Biodiesel or CNG.Storage.Capacity. Missing values might also correlate with station type, location, or infrastructure differences. For example: Urban areas may have more complete data for public-facing fields. Columns like E85.Other.Ethanol.Blends, Hydrogen.Pressures, or NG.Fill.Type.Primary have extremely high proportions of missing values because these fields pertain to specialized infrastructure that is only applicable to certain types of stations.\nCore information columns such as ZIP, Updated.At, Street.Address, Station.Name, City, State, and Latitude/Longitude have no missing values (or very few).

Level 2 chargers, typically used for residential and commercial purposes, offer a moderate charging speed, making them suitable for longer parking durations. On the other hand, DC Fast Chargers are designed for rapid charging, catering to drivers on long-distance trips or in need of quick top-ups. From the graph, we observe that states with a higher total number of EV chargers, such as California, Texas, and New York, also show a significant presence of both charger types, reflecting a balanced and comprehensive infrastructure.\n\n\nCode\nlevel2_and_fast_distribution &lt;- chargStat_selected |&gt;\n  select(State, EV.Level2.EVSE.Num, EV.DC.Fast.Count) |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = c(EV.Level2.EVSE.Num, EV.DC.Fast.Count),\n    names_to = \"Charger.Type\",\n    values_to = \"Count\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  group_by(State, Charger.Type) |&gt;\n  summarise(Total_Count = sum(Count), .groups = \"drop\") |&gt;\n  arrange(Charger.Type, desc(Total_Count))\n\n# Create faceted bar plot\nggplot(level2_and_fast_distribution, aes(x = reorder(State, -Total_Count), y = Total_Count, fill = Charger.Type)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", color = \"white\", position = \"stack\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Level 2 and DC Fast Charger Distribution by State\",\n    x = \"State\",\n    y = \"Total Count\",\n    fill = \"Charger Type\"\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_d(option = \"D\", direction = -1) + # Adjust for distinct color for Charger Type\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),\n    legend.position = \"top\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nThis distribution highlights a clear correlation between the overall availability of chargers and the diversity of charging options provided. States with larger EV adoption rates prioritize offering a mix of Level 2 and DC Fast Chargers to cater to various consumer needs. Interestingly, states with fewer chargers, such as Wyoming and Alaska, exhibit limited diversity, focusing primarily on either Level 2 or DC Fast Chargers. This trend underscores how states with robust EV ecosystems invest in accessibility and convenience, promoting EV adoption by addressing both daily and long-distance charging requirements."

    "text": "3.8 Charge Station Access ability\nThis pie chart reveals that a significant majority, approximately 66.9%, of fuel stations equipped with EV chargers operate 24 hours a day, ensuring round-the-clock accessibility for EV owners. This highlights the growing emphasis on convenience and accessibility in the EV charging infrastructure, catering to diverse consumer needs such as late-night charging or emergency top-ups. Conversely, around 33.1% of these stations do not operate 24 hours, which may reflect limitations in certain locations, such as rural areas, or operational constraints like staffing or energy costs. This disparity underscores the need for further infrastructure development, particularly in states where 24-hour access is limited, to support the expanding EV market and provide equitable access to charging facilities.\n\n\nCode\naccess_time_grouped &lt;- chargStat_selected |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    Access_Group = ifelse(grepl(\"^24 hours daily\", Access.Days.Time), \"24 Hours\", \"non 24 hours\")\n  )\n\n\noverall_distribution &lt;- access_time_grouped |&gt;\n  group_by(Access_Group) |&gt;\n  summarise(Count = n(), .groups = \"drop\") |&gt;\n  mutate(Percentage = (Count / sum(Count)) * 100)\n\n\nggplot(overall_distribution, aes(x = \"\", y = Percentage, fill = Access_Group)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", width = 1, color = \"white\") +\n  coord_polar(theta = \"y\") +\n  geom_text(aes(label = paste0(round(Percentage, 1), \"%\")), \n            position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5), size = 5, color = \"white\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Distribution of EV Chargers Access Time (U.S)\",\n    fill = \"Access Group\"\n  ) +\n  theme_void() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"24 Hours\" = \"dodgerblue\", \"non 24 hours\" = \"tomato\"))\n\n\n\n\n\nIn vary by state, we notice that the majority of EV charger stations operate 24 hours, as seen in states like California and New York, where the percentage is consistently high.
